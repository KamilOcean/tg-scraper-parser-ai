    After creation, you'll see:

      api_id - A number like 12345678
      api_hash - A long string like a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0

Create `.env` file in root folder of this project and fill it up with your credentials like this:

```bash
API_ID=12345678
API_HASH=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

**IMPORTANT! You must manually join these chats first.**
**IMPORTANT! You must manually join these chats first. (you can get it from the browser, go to the chat in browser and copy the id from the url, it starts with - sign, for example: -1001728635215, specify that - as well)**

```chats-to-scrape.json
[
  "-1001728635215", // not usernames, ids
  "-1001728635216"
]
```

6. Fill the 'ai-settings.json' file with your prompt and settings for your AI service.

> **IMPORTANT!**
> For now only DeepSeek is available. You also need to have an API key for DeepSeek and fill it up in the .env file. like this: DEEP_SEEK_TOKEN=your_token
> 

```ai-settings.json
{
  "prompt": "Your prompt",
  "model": "deepseek-chat",
  "max_tokens": 100,
  "temperature": 0.7

‚úÖ **Database integration** for message storage
‚úÖ **Advanced AI analysis** for intelligent filtering  
‚úÖ **Multi-account management** to avoid limits
‚úÖ **Real-time processing** for instant alerts
‚úÖ **Scalable architecture** for multiple channels
‚úÖ **Custom Development** - Tailored to your specific needs
